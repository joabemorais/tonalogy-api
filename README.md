## üìú About The Project

**Tonalogy API** is a tool for musicians, students, and music theory researchers. It takes a sequence of chords and, using a model based on Kripke structures, analyzes the possible tonalities and the stability of the harmonic progression. Its key feature is the ability to not only analyze but also **generate elegant and informative vector visualizations (SVG)** of the harmonic path, making complex music theory concepts much easier to understand.

> **Academic Context:** This system is the practical implementation of the undergraduate thesis entitled:
>
> *"A Computational Implementation for Tonality Analysis in Harmonic Progressions via Possible Worlds Semantics"*
>
> *Universidade Federal do Cear√° ‚Äì Campus Quixad√°*
>
> It serves as the applied component of this research, transforming a theoretical model into a practical software solution for tonal inference and musical interpretation. For a deeper dive into the theoretical foundations, you can [read the preliminary thesis document here](./docs/tcc1_ajamorais.pdf).

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Harmonic Analysis:** Evaluates chord progressions to determine their tonal characteristics.
-   **Kripke Model:** Uses modal logic to model the "possible worlds" of a harmonic progression.
-   **Graphic Visualization:** Generates SVG graphs that represent the tonal journey of the chords.
-   **RESTful API:** A simple, HTTP-based interface for easy integration with other applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11 or higher.
-   A package manager like `pip`.
-   Graphviz system package. (e.g., `sudo apt-get install graphviz` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/joabemorais/tonalogy-api.git](https://github.com/joabemorais/tonalogy-api.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd tonalogy-api
    ```

3.  **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install the dependencies**
    > **Note:** It's good practice to create a `requirements.txt` file in your project.
    ```sh
    pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] graphviz
    ```

5.  **Start the API server**
    ```sh
    uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    ```
    The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üí° Usage

You can interact with the API using any HTTP client. Here are some examples with `curl`.

### 1. Analyze a Progression

Send a list of chords to the `/api/analysis/` endpoint to receive a detailed analysis.

**Request:**
```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/analyze' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "chords": [
    "Em",
    "A",
    "Dm",
    "G",
    "C"
  ],
  "tonalities_to_test": []
}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "is_tonal_progression": true,
  "identified_tonality": "C Major",
  "explanation_details": [
    {
      "formal_rule_applied": "Analysis Start",
      "observation": "Testing progression with primary tonality: 'C Major'.",
      "processed_chord": null,
      "tonality_used_in_step": "C Major",
      "evaluated_functional_state": null
    },
    // ... rest of the analysis
  ]
}
```

### 2. Generate a Visualization

Send a list of chords to `/api/visualizer/` to generate an SVG graph of the analysis.

**Request:**
```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/visualize' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "chords": [
    "Em",
    "A",
    "Dm",
    "G",
    "C"
  ],
  "tonalities_to_test": []
}'
```

**Expected Response:**
Image of the generated SVG graph. No JSON, just the png file, as shown below:
